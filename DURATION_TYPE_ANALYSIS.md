# Duration Type Conversion Analysis

## Analysis Summary

After a comprehensive search through the codebase, I investigated the reported type conversion issue:
> "invalid operation: checkpoint.AvgLatency > int64(float64(previousLatency) * 1.5) (mismatched types time.Duration and int64)"

## Findings

**No actual type errors found.** The code in `tests/performance/scenarios/endurance_test.go` is correct:

### Examined Code Patterns

1. **Line 482** (reported issue):
   ```go
   if previousLatency > 0 && checkpoint.AvgLatency > time.Duration(float64(previousLatency)*1.5) {
   ```
   - ✅ **Correct**: Both `previousLatency` and `checkpoint.AvgLatency` are `time.Duration`
   - ✅ **Correct**: Converting `float64(previousLatency)*1.5` to `time.Duration`

2. **Line 309** (similar pattern):
   ```go
   if i > 0 && result.LatencyP95 > time.Duration(float64(previousLatency)*1.2) {
   ```
   - ✅ **Correct**: Same pattern as above

3. **Line 476** (duration conversion):
   ```go
   checkpoint.AvgLatency = time.Duration(currentLatency / currentRequests)
   ```
   - ✅ **Correct**: Converting `int64` division result to `time.Duration`

## Verified Types

- `previousLatency`: `time.Duration` (declared at lines 288, 448)
- `checkpoint.AvgLatency`: `time.Duration` (from struct definition line 348)
- `result.LatencyP95`: `time.Duration` (from benchmark result)

## Duration Arithmetic Best Practices Found

The codebase demonstrates excellent duration handling patterns:

### 1. Proper Float64 Multiplication
```go
time.Duration(float64(baseDelay) * multiplier)
```

### 2. Safe Division Conversions  
```go
avgLatency := time.Duration(totalLatency / int64(b.N))
```

### 3. Proper Comparisons
```go
if current.P95Latency > time.Duration(float64(baseline.P95Latency)*1.1) {
```

## Recommendation

The reported error may have been from:
1. A previous version of the code (already fixed)
2. A different file not identified in the search
3. A misinterpretation of the code patterns

**Current code is type-safe and follows Go best practices for duration arithmetic.**

## Build Verification

- ✅ `go build` successful on endurance_test.go
- ✅ `go vet` reports no issues  
- ✅ No compilation errors found in duration conversions
