# E2SM-KPM Profile (MVP)

This profile defines the KPM measurements our planner consumes from Near-RT RIC (via E2SIM or srsRAN gNB with E2).
It does not aim to cover the full KPM spec; it documents the minimal fields we rely on.

## Measurements (aggregated over 30s)
- `kpm.p95_latency_ms` — p95 of end-to-end UL+DL latency proxy reported by the E2 node/xApp pipeline.
- `kpm.prb_utilization` — physical resource block utilization ratio [0..1].
- `kpm.ue_count` — number of connected UEs.

## Collection path
E2 Node (E2SIM or srsRAN gNB) → E2 Termination (RIC) → KPM xApp/adapter → REST readout for planner.

## Sampling and freshness
- Sampling window: 30s
- Max staleness accepted by planner: 90s
- Missing data handling: treat as no-op (do not scale)

## Mapping to simulator
If using E2SIM: configure KPM model with these outputs.
If using srsRAN: enable E2 and expose KPM stats per cell; provide a small adapter that emits the three aggregates.
