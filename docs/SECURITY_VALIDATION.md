# Security Validation Summary

## Path Traversal Protection

The implementation uses a defense-in-depth approach with multiple layers of security validation:

### 1. Path Canonicalization (OWASP Rule 1)
- Uses `filepath.Clean()` to normalize paths
- Removes redundant separators and `.` segments
- Resolves `..` segments safely

### 2. Base Directory Joining (OWASP Rule 2)
- Relative paths are joined with current working directory
- Absolute paths are validated against safe boundaries
- Uses `filepath.Join()` for secure path construction

### 3. Boundary Verification (OWASP Rule 3)
- Validates resolved paths remain within expected boundaries
- `isPathSafe()` function checks against:
  - Current working directory
  - System temp directory
  - User home directory (Windows only)
- Rejects paths that escape safe boundaries

### 4. Secure Directory Creation (OWASP Rule 4)
- Creates directories with restrictive permissions (0755)
- Verifies parent directory exists and is accessible
- Tests write permissions with temporary file

## Error Messages

The implementation provides clear, security-conscious error messages:

- **Path traversal detected**: "path traversal detected in output directory: %q"
- **Parent directory missing**: "output directory parent does not exist"
- **Not a directory**: "output path is not a directory"
- **Permission denied**: "output directory is not writable: %q"

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

### Windows-Specific Validations
- Handles UNC paths (`\\server\share`)
- Validates against reserved device names (CON, PRN, AUX, etc.)
- Checks MAX_PATH limitations (260 characters)
- Normalizes forward/backward slashes

### Unix-Specific Validations
- Handles symlink traversal attempts
- Validates hidden directories (`.hidden`)
- Respects Unix permission model

## Test Coverage

The security validation is thoroughly tested with:

1. **Unit Tests** (`security_unit_test.go`)
   - Path traversal scenarios
   - Malicious input validation
   - Negative/extreme values

2. **Integration Tests** (`security_validation_test.go`)
   - Real file system operations
   - Intent validation
   - JSON security checks

3. **Platform-Specific Tests**
   - `windows_path_security_test.go`: Windows-specific attack vectors
   - `unix_path_security_test.go`: Unix-specific security scenarios

## Security Features

### Input Validation
- Filename pattern matching (must start with "intent-" and end with ".json")
- Size limits on JSON files (configurable, default 10MB)
- Type validation for JSON fields
- Rejection of null bytes and control characters

### Process Isolation
- File-level locking to prevent race conditions
- Debouncing to prevent DoS through rapid file creation
- Worker pool limits to prevent resource exhaustion
- Metrics endpoint authentication (optional)

### Logging Security
- Sanitizes error messages to remove:
  - Path traversal sequences (`../`)
  - Control characters (except newline, tab, carriage return)
  - Shell metacharacters in logged paths

## Compliance

The implementation follows:
- OWASP Path Traversal Prevention guidelines
- CWE-22 (Path Traversal) mitigation strategies
- Go security best practices
- Platform-specific security requirements

## Verification

To verify the security implementation:

```bash
# Run security-specific tests
go test -v ./internal/loop -run "Security|PathTraversal"

# Run with race detection
go test -race ./internal/loop

# Run with coverage
go test -cover ./internal/loop
```

## Notes

1. The implementation uses `assertErrorContainsAny()` for flexible error assertions to handle OS-specific error messages
2. Path validation occurs before any file operations
3. All user-provided paths are canonicalized and validated
4. The system maintains strong security without weakening validation for compatibility
