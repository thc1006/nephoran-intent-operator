# Progress Append (Append-only Log)

Read **@CLAUDE_AGENTS_ANALYSIS.md** and `.claude/agents/*` first, then apply the Agent Bootstrap plan.

Task:
- Append **one line** to `docs/PROGRESS.md` using the helper script:
  `.\scripts\add-progress.ps1 -Module "<module>" -Summary "<<= 15 words>"`
- Do not rewrite history. If conflicts arise, keep both lines.

Deliverables:
- Show the exact line appended.
- Stage/commit/push commands to sync the log.
