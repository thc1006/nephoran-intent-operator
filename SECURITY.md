## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for the vulnerability
2. Email your findings to security@nephoran.io
3. Include the following information:
   - Type of vulnerability (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, RCE)
   - Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
   - Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
   - Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
   - Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
   - Impact of the vulnerability, including how an attacker might exploit it

## Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Patch Development**: Based on severity
  - CRITICAL: Within 24 hours
  - HIGH: Within 7 days
  - MEDIUM: Within 30 days
  - LOW: Within 90 days

## Disclosure Policy

- Security vulnerabilities will be disclosed via GitHub Security Advisories
- We follow a coordinated disclosure timeline:
  1. Security report received
  2. Vulnerability confirmed and assessed
  3. Patch developed and tested
  4. Patch released with security advisory
  5. Public disclosure after 90 days or when patch is available

## Dependency Security Management

### Principles

1. **Minimal Dependencies**: We maintain the smallest possible dependency footprint
2. **Regular Updates**: Dependencies are reviewed and updated monthly
3. **Security First**: Security vulnerabilities take priority over features
4. **Supply Chain Security**: All dependencies are verified and scanned

### Dependency Guidelines

#### Acceptable Dependencies
- Actively maintained (commits within last 6 months)
- Clear security policy and vulnerability disclosure
- Compatible open-source license (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD)
- Passes security scanning without high/critical vulnerabilities
- Provides clear value that cannot be easily implemented

#### Prohibited Dependencies
- GPL/AGPL licensed packages (incompatible with project license)
- Deprecated or archived projects
- Dependencies with known unpatched vulnerabilities
- Packages without clear maintainership
- Heavy dependencies that can be replaced with lighter alternatives

### Security Scanning

All dependencies are automatically scanned using:
- **Go**: govulncheck, nancy (Sonatype OSS Index)
- **Python**: pip-audit, safety, bandit
- **Containers**: Trivy, Snyk
- **SBOM**: CycloneDX format for supply chain transparency

### Update Process

1. **Monthly Review**: First Tuesday of each month
2. **Automated PR**: Dependabot creates update PRs
3. **Security Updates**: Applied within 48 hours for critical vulnerabilities
4. **Testing**: All updates must pass full test suite
5. **Rollback Plan**: Previous versions maintained for quick rollback

## Recent Security Enhancements (v0.2.0)

### Critical Security Fixes

The latest release includes significant security improvements addressing input validation, command injection prevention, and secure timestamp handling:

#### 1. Enhanced Input Validation and Path Traversal Prevention

**Module**: `internal/patchgen` and `planner/internal/security`

- **Comprehensive Input Validation**: All user inputs validated against strict schemas and security rules
- **Path Traversal Protection**: File paths sanitized using `filepath.Clean()` to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **URL Validation**: URLs parsed and validated against allowed schemes (HTTP/HTTPS only)
- **Node ID Security**: O-RAN node identifiers validated using regex patterns to prevent injection attacks

Implementation:
```go
// Prevent directory traversal attacks
cleanPath := filepath.Clean(path)
if strings.Contains(cleanPath, "..") {
    return ValidationError{
        Field:   "file_path",
        Reason:  "file path contains directory traversal sequences (..)",
    }
}
```

#### 2. Secure Command Execution

**Module**: `internal/patchgen` and `internal/patch`

- **Input Sanitization**: All command inputs validated before execution
- **Command Injection Prevention**: Use of parameterized commands and input validation
- **File Permission Controls**: Proper file permissions (0644 for files, 0755 for directories)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling preventing information disclosure

#### 3. Timestamp Security and Collision Prevention

**Module**: `internal/patchgen`

- **RFC3339 Timestamp Format**: All timestamps use standardized RFC3339 format for consistency
- **UTC Timezone Normalization**: All timestamps normalized to UTC preventing timezone attacks
- **Collision-Resistant Naming**: Package names include timestamps to prevent naming collisions
- **Timestamp Validation**: Timestamps validated to prevent replay attacks and future-dating

Implementation:
```go
// Secure timestamp generation
"nephoran.io/generated-at": time.Now().UTC().Format(time.RFC3339)
```

#### 4. JSON Schema Validation Enhancement

**Module**: `internal/patchgen/validator.go`

- **JSON Schema 2020-12 Compliance**: Uses latest JSON Schema specification
- **Strict Validation**: All intent data validated against comprehensive schema
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing prevents injection through type confusion
- **Bounds Checking**: Numeric values validated within acceptable ranges

#### 5. Secure Logging and Audit Trail

**Module**: `planner/internal/security/validation.go`

- **Log Injection Prevention**: All logged values sanitized to prevent log injection
- **Sensitive Data Filtering**: Automatic truncation and sanitization of logged values
- **Structured Logging**: Use of structured logging to prevent format string attacks

### Migration from internal/patch to internal/patchgen

The migration introduced several security enhancements:

- **Enhanced Validation**: Comprehensive JSON Schema validation with OWASP compliance
- **Secure File Handling**: Path traversal prevention, permission controls, error handling
- **Timestamp Security**: RFC3339 format with collision prevention and validation

**Migration Steps**:
1. Update imports: `internal/patch` â†’ `internal/patchgen`
2. All intent data must pass JSON Schema validation
3. Update error handling for new validation errors
4. Update tests to account for enhanced security validation
