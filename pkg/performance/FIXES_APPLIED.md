# Performance Package Fixes Applied

## Fixed Duplicate Declarations

### 1. MetricsCollector
- **Issue**: Type `MetricsCollector` was declared in both `missing_core_types.go` and `metrics_collector.go`
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate declaration from `missing_core_types.go`, kept the original in `metrics_collector.go`

### 2. PerformanceBaseline
- **Issue**: Type `PerformanceBaseline` was declared in both `missing_core_types.go` and `benchmark_suite.go`
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate declaration from `missing_core_types.go`, kept the original in `benchmark_suite.go`

### 3. BenchmarkResult
- **Issue**: Type `BenchmarkResult` was declared in both `missing_core_types.go` and `benchmark_suite.go`
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate declaration from `missing_core_types.go`, kept the original in `benchmark_suite.go`

## Fixed Missing Types

### 1. Task and TaskPriority
- **Issue**: `Task` struct and `TaskPriority` type were undefined
- **Fix**: Added `Task` struct and `TaskPriority` type with constants (`PriorityNormal`, `PriorityHigh`, `PriorityCritical`) to `missing_types.go`

### 2. GoroutinePoolConfig
- **Issue**: `GoroutinePoolConfig` type was undefined
- **Fix**: Added `GoroutinePoolConfig` struct to `missing_types.go`

### 3. DefaultPoolConfig
- **Issue**: `DefaultPoolConfig()` function was undefined
- **Fix**: Added `DefaultPoolConfig()` function that returns a `*GoroutinePoolConfig` to `missing_types.go`

## Fixed Constructor Mismatches

### 1. NewEnhancedGoroutinePool
- **Issue**: Constructor expected `(workers, maxWorkers int)` but was called with `(*GoroutinePoolConfig)`
- **Fix**: Updated constructor signature to accept `*GoroutinePoolConfig` parameter

### 2. EnhancedGoroutinePool.SubmitTask
- **Issue**: Method `SubmitTask(*Task)` was missing
- **Fix**: Added `SubmitTask(*Task)` method that wraps the existing `Submit(func())` method

### 3. EnhancedGoroutinePool.GetMetrics
- **Issue**: Method `GetMetrics()` was missing
- **Fix**: Added `GetMetrics()` method that returns `*GoroutinePoolMetrics`

## Remaining Issues

The remaining build errors are related to missing Go module dependencies, not code issues:
- `github.com/bytedance/sonic`
- `github.com/google/pprof/profile`
- `github.com/gorilla/mux`
- `github.com/prometheus/client_golang/prometheus`
- `github.com/redis/go-redis/v9`
- `github.com/valyala/fastjson`
- `golang.org/x/net/http2`
- `golang.org/x/sync/singleflight`
- `k8s.io/client-go/util/workqueue`
- `k8s.io/klog/v2`

These can be resolved by running:
```bash
go get -u ./...
go mod tidy
```

## Files Modified

1. `missing_core_types.go` - Removed duplicate type declarations
2. `missing_types.go` - Added missing types and functions

## Verification

To verify the fixes:
```bash
cd pkg/performance
go build ./...  # Should only show dependency errors, no duplicate/undefined errors
```
