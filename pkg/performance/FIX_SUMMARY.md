# Performance Package Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ProfilerConfig Missing Fields
**Problem**: ProfilerConfig struct was missing the following fields used in DefaultProfilerConfig():
- `EnableCPUProfiling`
- `EnableMemoryProfiling`  
- `EnableGoroutineMonitoring`

**Solution**: Added these fields to ProfilerConfig struct in `profiler_enhanced.go` (lines 108-110)

### 2. HotSpot Struct Initialization
**Problem**: HotSpot struct initialization in `flamegraph_generator.go` was missing required fields:
- File
- Line
- Duration
- MemoryBytes
- Severity
- Samples
- Percentage

**Solution**: Updated HotSpot initialization in `flamegraph_generator.go` (lines 713-734) to include all required fields with appropriate default values. Also added logic to calculate severity based on CPU percentage thresholds:
- Critical: > 20%
- High: > 10%
- Medium: > 5%
- Low: <= 5%

## Files Modified

1. **pkg/performance/profiler_enhanced.go**
   - Added missing fields to ProfilerConfig struct

2. **pkg/performance/flamegraph_generator.go**
   - Fixed HotSpot struct initialization with all required fields
   - Added severity calculation logic based on CPU percentage

## Validation

The compilation errors for HotSpot and ProfilerConfig have been resolved. The package now compiles without these specific errors.
