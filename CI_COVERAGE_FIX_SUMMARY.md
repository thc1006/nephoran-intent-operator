# CI Coverage Fix Summary

## Problem
The CI workflow was failing because it tried to copy `test-results/coverage-1.out` but the file wasn't being generated correctly. The test command was creating coverage files with dynamic names (`coverage-$attempt.out`) but the copy step expected a fixed name.

## Root Causes
1. **Mismatched file naming**: Tests generated `coverage-$attempt.out` but code expected `coverage-1.out`
2. **Missing error handling**: No validation that coverage files were actually created
3. **Race condition incompatibility**: Using `-race` flag with `CGO_ENABLED=0` causes test failures
4. **No partial coverage handling**: When tests failed, coverage data was lost

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Coverage File Generation and Copy Logic
- Added explicit checks to verify coverage files exist after test runs
- Properly copy `coverage-$attempt.out` to `coverage.out` for both Unix and Windows
- Added clear error messages when coverage files are missing

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added validation to ensure coverage file exists before processing
- Fail the workflow with clear error messages if coverage is missing after successful tests
- Added warnings for non-critical failures (HTML/summary generation)

### 3. Removed Race Detection Flag
- Removed `-race` flag when `CGO_ENABLED=0` to prevent test execution failures
- Added comment explaining why race detection is disabled

### 4. Added Partial Coverage Support
- Preserve partial coverage files even when tests fail
- Copy partial coverage to `coverage-partial-$attempt.out` for debugging
- Keep the last attempt's coverage as the main file for failed tests

### 5. Improved Logging
- Added emoji indicators for better visual feedback
- Display coverage summary in the CI logs
- Show coverage percentage after successful test runs

## Files Modified
- `.github/workflows/ci-enhanced.yml` - Main CI workflow with all the fixes
- `scripts/test-ci-coverage.ps1` - Test script to validate the coverage generation locally

## Testing
The changes have been tested locally and:
- Coverage files are generated correctly with the naming pattern `coverage-$attempt.out`
- Files are properly copied to `coverage.out` for downstream processing
- Error messages are clear when coverage generation fails
- Partial coverage is preserved even when tests fail

## Impact
- CI builds will no longer fail due to missing coverage files
- Coverage data is preserved even for failed test runs
- Better debugging information available through improved logging
- Compatible with both Unix and Windows runners
