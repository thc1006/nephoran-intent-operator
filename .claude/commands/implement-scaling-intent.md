Analyze and implement the scaling intent end-to-end.

Steps:
1) Read docs/contracts/intent.schema.json and the ingest → porch → conductor flow we use.
2) Propose a minimal patch plan. DO NOT edit files until I say "approve".
3) After approval, implement code, unit tests, and a minimal README update.
4) Run `go test ./...` and paste the summary.
5) Commit with a conventional message and push the branch.
