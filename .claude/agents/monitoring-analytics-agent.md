- **Analytics Pipelines**: Real-time and batch processing workflows
- **Performance Reports**: Automated KPI reports with trend analysis
- **Predictive Models**: ML models for anomaly detection and forecasting
- **Integration Documentation**: NWDAF and monitoring system integration guides

## Telecom-Specific Monitoring

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **RAN Metrics**: PRB utilization, throughput, latency, handover success rate
- **Core Network**: Session establishment rate, packet loss, jitter
- **Service Quality**: QoS/QoE metrics, SLA compliance
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, network, storage across all components

### NWDAF Integration

- Data collection from network functions
- Analytics function deployment
- ML model integration for network intelligence
- Closed-loop automation support

## Best Practices

- Implement monitoring as code for consistency
- Use sampling and aggregation to manage data volume
- Establish baseline metrics for anomaly detection
- Correlate metrics, logs, and traces for complete observability
- Automate common troubleshooting procedures
- Maintain historical data for trend analysis
- Document alert response procedures

Focus on providing actionable insights that enable proactive network management and optimization, reducing MTTR (Mean Time To Repair) and improving overall network reliability.
