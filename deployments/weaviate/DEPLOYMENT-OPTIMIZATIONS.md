# Weaviate Deployment Optimizations Guide

This document outlines the comprehensive optimizations implemented for the Weaviate vector database deployment in the Nephoran Intent Operator system.

## Overview of Optimizations

The following critical optimizations have been implemented based on technical analysis:

### 1. Storage Class Abstraction (HIGH PRIORITY - RESOLVED)

**Problem**: Hardcoded AWS storage classes limiting multi-cloud compatibility.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented dynamic storage class detection script (`storage-class-detector.sh`)
- Cloud-agnostic storage configuration in `values.yaml`
- Automatic detection of AWS, GCP, Azure, and generic storage classes

**Usage**:
```bash
# Run before deployment to detect optimal storage classes
./storage-class-detector.sh -o weaviate-storage-override.yaml

# Deploy with detected storage configuration
helm install weaviate -f values.yaml -f weaviate-storage-override.yaml
```

### 2. OpenAI Rate Limiting Mitigation (HIGH PRIORITY - RESOLVED)

**Problem**: OpenAI API rate limits causing embedding failures.

**Solution**:
- Implemented exponential backoff in `weaviate_client.go`
- Added circuit breaker patterns for API resilience
- Configured local embedding model fallback (sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2)
- Queue-based processing with rate limiting

**Features**:
- Token bucket rate limiting (3000 requests/min, 1M tokens/min)
- Circuit breaker with 3-failure threshold and 60s timeout
- Exponential backoff with jitter (1s base, 30s max, 2x multiplier)
- Automatic fallback to local embedding models

### 3. Resource Right-sizing (HIGH PRIORITY - RESOLVED)

**Problem**: Over-allocated resources leading to waste and inefficiency.

**Solution**:
- Optimized memory allocation from 4Gi to 2Gi (requests) and 16Gi to 8Gi (limits)
- Adjusted CPU requests from 1000m to 500m and limits from 4000m to 2000m
- Updated HPA thresholds: CPU 60% (down from 70%), Memory 70% (down from 80%)
- Implemented horizontal pod autoscaling with optimized scaling behavior

### 4. Database Schema Enhancement (MEDIUM PRIORITY - RESOLVED)

**Problem**: Non-optimized HNSW parameters and chunking strategy.

**Solution**:
- Optimized HNSW parameters for telecom domain:
  - `MAX_CONNECTIONS`: 16 (balanced for telecom workloads)
  - `EF_CONSTRUCTION`: 128 (quality vs performance balance)
  - `EF`: 64 (search speed optimization)
- Implemented section-aware chunking strategy:
  - Chunk size: 512 tokens (optimized for telecom content)
  - Overlap: 50 tokens (optimal context preservation)
  - Hierarchy-aware processing with technical term preservation

### 5. Integration Health Checks (MEDIUM PRIORITY - RESOLVED)

**Problem**: Poor health check configuration leading to slow failure detection.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced probe configurations:
  - Startup probe: 15s initial delay, 5s period, 20 max failures
  - Readiness probe: 30s initial delay, 10s period, 3s timeout
  - Liveness probe: 60s initial delay, 30s period, 5s timeout
- Proper authorization headers for authenticated endpoints
- Faster failure detection and recovery

### 6. Security Enhancements (LOW PRIORITY - RESOLVED)

**Problem**: Manual key management and lack of backup validation.

**Solution**:
- Automated backup validation script (`backup-validation.sh`)
- Encryption key rotation automation (`key-rotation.sh`)
- Comprehensive backup integrity testing
- 90-day key rotation schedule with 7-day warnings

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Pre-deployment Setup

1. **Detect Storage Classes**:
   ```bash
   cd deployments/weaviate
   ./storage-class-detector.sh --output storage-override.yaml
   ```

2. **Verify Secrets**:
   ```bash
   # Ensure API keys are configured
   kubectl get secret weaviate-api-key openai-api-key -n nephoran-system
   ```

### Step 2: Deploy Optimized Weaviate

1. **Deploy with Optimizations**:
   ```bash
   # Using Helm (recommended)
   helm install weaviate -f values.yaml -f storage-override.yaml -n nephoran-system
   
   # Or using kubectl directly
   kubectl apply -f weaviate-deployment.yaml -n nephoran-system
   ```

2. **Verify Deployment**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods -n nephoran-system -l app=weaviate
   kubectl logs -n nephoran-system -l app=weaviate --tail=50
   ```

### Step 3: Post-deployment Validation

1. **Test Connectivity**:
   ```bash
   kubectl port-forward svc/weaviate 8080:8080 -n nephoran-system
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>" http://localhost:8080/v1/.well-known/ready
   ```

2. **Validate Backup System**:
   ```bash
   ./backup-validation.sh validate
   ./backup-validation.sh test-backup
   ```

3. **Check Key Rotation Status**:
   ```bash
   ./key-rotation.sh check
   ```

## Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Resource Utilization**:
   - Memory usage should stay below 70% of limits
   - CPU usage should average 40-60% of limits
   - Storage I/O latency and throughput

2. **Vector Operations**:
   - Query latency (target: <500ms P99)
   - Indexing throughput
   - Embedding generation success rate

3. **Integration Health**:
   - Circuit breaker state and failure rates
   - Rate limiting efficiency
   - Backup validation success rate

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Check pod resource usage
kubectl top pods -n nephoran-system -l app=weaviate

# View HPA status
kubectl get hpa weaviate-hpa -n nephoran-system

# Check service metrics
kubectl port-forward svc/weaviate 2112:2112 -n nephoran-system
curl http://localhost:2112/metrics | grep weaviate
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **High Memory Usage**:
   ```bash
   # Check VECTOR_CACHE_MAX_OBJECTS setting
   kubectl logs -n nephoran-system deployment/weaviate | grep -i "memory\|cache"
   
   # Adjust cache settings if needed
   kubectl patch deployment weaviate -n nephoran-system -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"weaviate","env":[{"name":"VECTOR_CACHE_MAX_OBJECTS","value":"1500000"}]}]}}}}'
   ```

2. **OpenAI Rate Limiting**:
   ```bash
   # Check circuit breaker status
   kubectl logs -n nephoran-system deployment/weaviate | grep -i "circuit\|rate"
   
   # Verify fallback model availability
   kubectl describe deployment weaviate -n nephoran-system | grep -A 5 -B 5 "embedding"
   ```

3. **Storage Issues**:
   ```bash
   # Check PVC status
   kubectl get pvc -n nephoran-system
   
   # Verify storage class
   kubectl describe pvc weaviate-pvc -n nephoran-system | grep -i "storageclass\|provisioner"
   ```

### Emergency Procedures

1. **Backup Recovery**:
   ```bash
   ./backup-validation.sh restore-test <backup-id>
   ```

2. **Key Rotation Emergency**:
   ```bash
   ./key-rotation.sh rotate force
   ```

3. **Resource Scaling**:
   ```bash
   # Temporary resource increase
   kubectl patch deployment weaviate -n nephoran-system -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"weaviate","resources":{"limits":{"memory":"12Gi","cpu":"3000m"}}}]}}}}'
   ```
