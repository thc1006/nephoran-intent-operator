- **Secure OAuth2 client secret loading**: Implemented robust OAuth2 client secret loading mechanism with file-based and environment variable fallbacks for enhanced security and deployment flexibility
- **OAuth2 provider configuration**: Completed comprehensive OAuth2 provider configuration system with secure provider enumeration and validation
- **Multi-provider API keys management**: Added comprehensive API keys loading system supporting multiple providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure) with validation and secure fallback mechanisms

#### O-RAN Functionality Improvements
- **Enhanced E2 control message handling**: Implemented explicit node ID targeting in E2 control messages for precise O-RAN network element management
- **O-RAN E2 compliance**: Added comprehensive control header parsing with full O-RAN E2 specification compliance for standards-based network operations

- **YANG model XPath validation**: Added YANG model XPath validation against O-RAN schemas ensuring configuration compliance and data model integrity

#### Monitoring & Operations
- **RAG service health checking**: Implemented comprehensive RAG service health monitoring with performance metrics, component status tracking, and degradation detection

#### Development Tools
- **Individual service build targets**: Added granular Makefile build targets for individual services with Docker integration, improving development workflow and CI/CD efficiency

### Changed

#### Performance Optimizations
- Enhanced retrieval service with advanced query processing, semantic reranking, and context assembly capabilities
- Improved embedding service with circuit breaker patterns and fallback mechanisms
- Optimized Weaviate client with rate limiting and connection pooling

#### Configuration Management
- Streamlined OAuth2 configuration with environment-based overrides
- Enhanced API key management with provider-specific validation
- Improved O-RAN configuration parsing with schema validation

### Fixed

#### Authentication & Authorization
- Resolved OAuth2 client secret loading edge cases with proper error handling
- Fixed API key validation for multi-provider environments
- Corrected OAuth2 provider enumeration for dynamic provider discovery

#### O-RAN Integration
- Fixed E2 control message routing with explicit node targeting
- Resolved control header parsing compatibility issues with O-RAN specifications
- Corrected requestor ID mapping for various network element types
- Fixed YANG model validation against O-RAN schema specifications

#### Service Reliability

- Fixed build target dependencies in Makefile for individual services

### Security

#### Critical Security Fixes (v0.2.0)
- **Path Traversal Prevention**: Implemented comprehensive file path validation using `filepath.Clean()` to prevent directory traversal attacks
- **Command Injection Prevention**: Enhanced command execution with input sanitization and parameterized commands
- **Timestamp Attack Mitigation**: RFC3339 format with UTC normalization prevents timezone-based attacks and replay attempts
- **Input Validation Framework**: OWASP-compliant validation system with comprehensive bounds checking and type safety
- **Secure File Operations**: Proper file permissions (0644 for files, 0755 for directories) with error handling improvements

#### Authentication Hardening
- Implemented secure file-based OAuth2 client secret loading with proper permissions validation
- Added environment variable fallbacks with secure handling and logging protection
- Enhanced API key storage and retrieval with encryption support

#### Configuration Security
- Secured OAuth2 provider configuration with input validation and sanitization
- Added secure provider enumeration preventing configuration injection attacks
- Implemented comprehensive API key validation with rate limiting and abuse protection

### Breaking Changes

#### Module Migration: internal/patch â†’ internal/patchgen

**Impact**: All code using `internal/patch` must be updated to use `internal/patchgen`

**Migration Steps**:
1. **Update Imports**: Change all imports from `internal/patch` to `internal/patchgen`
2. **Schema Validation**: All intent data must now pass JSON Schema 2020-12 validation
3. **Error Handling**: Update error handling to accommodate new validation errors
4. **Testing**: Update tests to account for enhanced security validation requirements

**Security Benefits**:
- Enhanced input validation with comprehensive schema checking
- Path traversal attack prevention
- Secure timestamp generation with collision resistance
- Improved file handling with proper permissions and error handling

**Example Migration**:
```go
// Before (internal/patch)
import "github.com/thc1006/nephoran-intent-operator/internal/patch"

// After (internal/patchgen)  
import "github.com/thc1006/nephoran-intent-operator/internal/patchgen"

// New validation requirement
validator, err := patchgen.NewValidator(logger)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("failed to create validator: %w", err)
}

intent, err := validator.ValidateIntent(intentData)
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("validation failed: %w", err)
}
```
