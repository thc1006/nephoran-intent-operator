**Analyzed Repository**: Nephoran Intent Operator  
**Analysis Date**: 2025-01-23  
**DevOps Engineer**: Claude (AI DevOps Specialist)  

## üìä Current State Analysis

### Workflow Inventory
- **Total Workflows**: 16+ active workflow files
- **Primary Pipelines**: CI, Security Enhanced, Quality Gate, Conductor Loop
- **Current Architecture**: Multiple independent workflows with some overlap
- **Estimated Total Runtime**: 45-60 minutes (comprehensive)

### Performance Bottlenecks Identified

1. **Dependency Management Inefficiency**
   - Multiple jobs downloading Go modules independently
   - Cache hit rates estimated at 60-70%

2. **Sequential Execution Patterns**
   - Over-dependent job chains limiting parallelization
   - Windows tests running sequentially with retry logic (20+ minutes)
   - Security scans running in single workflow instead of parallel

3. **Resource Under-utilization**
   - Standard runners for compute-intensive tasks
   - Limited parallel job execution (2-3 concurrent)
   - Inefficient artifact sharing between jobs

4. **Workflow Overlap and Redundancy**
