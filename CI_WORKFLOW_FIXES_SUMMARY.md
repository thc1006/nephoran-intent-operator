## Summary of GitHub Actions CI Workflow Fixes

### Issues Identified and Fixed:

#### 1. Docker Build Module Cache Permission Issues
**Problem**: Go module downloads failing with 'permission denied' errors when writing to cache
**Root Cause**: Mismatch between cache directory permissions and BuildKit mount permissions
**Solutions**:
- Fixed cache directory ownership with proper chown commands
- Added permission fixes in multiple Dockerfile stages  
- Enhanced retry logic for module downloads
- Added proper error handling with fallback methods

#### 2. Trivy Installation and Version Issues
**Problem**: Using outdated Trivy action version 0.28.0 causing compatibility issues
**Solutions**:
- Updated to Trivy action version 0.29.0
- Added multiple installation fallback methods (APT repo, binary download, manual)
- Enhanced error handling for all security tool installations

#### 3. Docker Buildx Configuration Issues
**Problem**: Buildx setup not optimized for current GitHub runners
**Solutions**:
- Updated buildx driver configuration with specific BuildKit version
- Reduced parallelism and memory usage for stability
- Disabled problematic SBOM/provenance for faster builds
- Added network configuration for better connectivity

#### 4. Security Tool Installation Failures
**Problem**: Multiple security tools failing to install due to outdated methods
**Solutions**:
- Updated all tool versions to latest stable releases
- Added comprehensive fallback installation methods
- Enhanced TruffleHog, Gitleaks, GoSec, Nancy, OSV-Scanner installations
- Improved Hadolint and Dockle installations with version pinning

#### 5. Missing 2025 Standards Compliance
**Problem**: Workflows not meeting latest GitHub Actions and security standards
**Solutions**:
- Created new security-tools-2025.yml workflow for testing compatibility
- Updated all security scanning configurations to 2025 standards
- Enhanced SAST workflows with better Semgrep integration
- Improved dependency scanning with multiple tools
