# Merge Validation Plan: feat/e2e → integrate/mvp

## Pre-Merge Checklist ✅

- [x] **Workflow Analysis Complete**: 33 workflows analyzed
- [x] **Critical Security Fix Applied**: security-enhanced-ci.yml concurrency group added
- [x] **Build Functionality Validated**: Core components build successfully
- [x] **Concurrency Groups Verified**: All active workflows have unique groups
- [x] **Redundant Workflows Disabled**: 5+ workflows converted to manual-only
- [x] **Resource Impact Assessed**: 5-6 max concurrent workflows estimated

## Merge Strategy

### Phase 1: Pre-Merge Preparation (COMPLETE)
```bash
# Already completed in feat/e2e branch:
git status  # Confirm clean state
go build ./cmd/intent-ingest  # Validate builds
```

### Phase 2: Merge Execution
```bash
# Switch to integrate/mvp
git checkout integrate/mvp
git pull origin integrate/mvp

# Merge feat/e2e
git merge feat/e2e --no-ff -m "feat(ci): comprehensive workflow validation and cleanup

- Fix critical security-enhanced-ci.yml concurrency issue
- Disable redundant workflows to prevent conflicts
- Validate core CI functionality and builds
- Optimize workflow resource usage for merge safety

Tested components: intent-ingest, conductor, webhook
Active workflows: ci-production.yml, main-ci-optimized-2025.yml, security-enhanced-ci.yml
Risk level: LOW ✅

# Push merge
git push origin integrate/mvp
```

### Phase 3: Post-Merge Validation (0-2 hours)
```bash
# Monitor first CI runs
gh run list --branch integrate/mvp --limit 10

# Check for conflicts
gh run list --status in_progress
gh run list --status queued

# Validate specific workflows
gh workflow list --all
```

## Expected Workflow Behavior Post-Merge

### Primary Workflows (Will Auto-Trigger)
1. **ci-production.yml** 
   - Expected runtime: 8-15 minutes
   - Concurrency: `nephoran-ci-production-${{ github.ref }}`
   - Expected outcome: ✅ Success (tested builds work)

2. **main-ci-optimized-2025.yml**
   - Expected runtime: 10-20 minutes  
   - Concurrency: `main-ci-${{ github.ref }}-${{ github.event_name }}`
   - Expected outcome: ✅ Success (comprehensive build)

3. **security-enhanced-ci.yml**
   - Expected runtime: 15-25 minutes
   - Concurrency: `security-enhanced-ci-${{ github.ref }}` (NEWLY ADDED)
   - Expected outcome: ✅ Success (security scans)

### Monitoring Points
- **No overlapping executions** in concurrency groups
- **Sequential execution** where appropriate
- **Artifact generation** without conflicts
- **Resource usage** within GitHub limits

## Success Criteria

### ✅ Merge Success Indicators
1. All auto-trigger workflows start within 2 minutes
2. No workflow failures due to concurrency conflicts  
3. Primary CI (ci-production.yml) completes successfully
4. Security scans execute without resource contention
5. No more than 6 workflows running simultaneously

### ⚠️ Warning Indicators (Monitor Closely)
1. Queue times >5 minutes for workflows
2. Any workflow failures with "Resource not available" errors
3. Concurrent executions of same concurrency group
4. Memory/timeout errors in builds

### 🚨 Failure Indicators (Trigger Rollback)
1. >50% workflow failure rate within first hour
2. Complete CI pipeline breakdown
3. Resource exhaustion preventing new runs
4. Security vulnerabilities introduced by workflow changes

## Rollback Strategy

### Level 1: Selective Workflow Disable (Use if specific workflows cause issues)
```bash
# Disable problematic workflow
gh workflow disable .github/workflows/security-enhanced-ci.yml

# Or convert to manual-only
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/workflows/ID/dispatches
```

### Level 2: Revert to Single CI (Use if multiple workflows conflict)
```bash
# Keep only primary CI active
gh workflow disable .github/workflows/main-ci-optimized-2025.yml
gh workflow disable .github/workflows/security-enhanced-ci.yml

# Verify only ci-production.yml remains active
gh workflow list --all | grep -E "(ci-production|enabled)"
```

### Level 3: Full Merge Rollback (Use if critical failures occur)
```bash
# Emergency rollback
git checkout integrate/mvp
git reset --hard HEAD~1  # Remove merge commit
git push --force-with-lease origin integrate/mvp

# Alternative: Create fix branch
git checkout -b hotfix/workflow-conflicts
git revert <merge-commit-hash>
git push origin hotfix/workflow-conflicts
```

## Post-Merge Monitoring Plan

### Hour 1: Intensive Monitoring
- [ ] Check workflow run status every 10 minutes
- [ ] Monitor resource usage and queue times  
- [ ] Verify no concurrency violations
- [ ] Validate build artifact generation

### Hours 1-6: Active Monitoring  
- [ ] Check for any delayed failures
- [ ] Monitor subsequent pushes/PRs trigger correctly
- [ ] Verify security scan completion
- [ ] Check artifact storage consumption

### Hours 6-24: Periodic Monitoring
- [ ] Review full workflow execution patterns
- [ ] Analyze performance metrics
- [ ] Check for any user-reported issues
- [ ] Validate end-to-end CI/CD pipeline

### Week 1: Stability Assessment
- [ ] Analyze workflow success rates
- [ ] Review resource utilization trends
- [ ] Gather developer feedback
- [ ] Plan any optimization improvements
