# Security Conflict Resolution Summary

**Date**: 2025-08-28
**Resolution Type**: Merge Conflict Resolution (feat/e2e ← integrate/mvp)
**Security Auditor**: Claude Security Specialist

## Executive Summary

Successfully resolved all security-related merge conflicts while preserving security enhancements from both branches. The resolution maintains compliance with OWASP Top 10 2021, O-RAN WG11 L Release, and NIST Cybersecurity Framework standards.

## Resolved Conflicts

### 1. CI/CD Security Pipeline (`deployments/security/cicd-security-pipeline.yaml`)
**Resolution Strategy**: Preserved comprehensive security scanning configuration
- ✅ Maintained GitLab CI security stages
- ✅ Preserved GitHub Actions security workflows
- ✅ Kept Jenkins pipeline security configuration
- ✅ Retained all security quality gates and compliance checks
- **Security Impact**: Full CI/CD security coverage maintained

### 2. Certificate Authority Manager (`pkg/security/ca/manager.go`)
**Resolution Strategy**: Merged both policy engine approaches
- ✅ Combined strict enforcement mode with validation rules
- ✅ Preserved certificate pinning configuration
- ✅ Maintained algorithm strength checking
- ✅ Kept RSA key size (2048-bit minimum) and EC curves configuration
- **Security Impact**: Enhanced certificate security with comprehensive policy enforcement

### 3. Security Tests (`tests/security/patchgen_test.go`)
**Resolution Strategy**: Cleaned up duplicate imports
- ✅ Removed conflicting import statements
- ✅ Preserved all security test cases
- ✅ Maintained concurrent safety testing
- **Security Impact**: Security test coverage fully preserved

### 4. Security Audit Report (`SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`)
**Resolution Strategy**: Created unified report with latest updates
- ✅ Updated report version to 3.0
- ✅ Combined security findings from both branches
- ✅ Updated compliance framework references
- ✅ Preserved all security implementation details
- **Security Impact**: Comprehensive audit trail maintained

### 5. Security Workflow (``.github/workflows/security-enhanced.yml.disabled`)
**Resolution Strategy**: Preserved as disabled for future activation
- ✅ Maintained supply chain security validation
- ✅ Kept advanced static analysis configuration
- ✅ Preserved secret detection setup
- **Security Impact**: Advanced security scanning ready for activation
