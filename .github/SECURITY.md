## Security Architecture

### Zero-Trust Principles

1. **Never Trust, Always Verify**: All communications are authenticated and authorized
2. **Least Privilege Access**: Components operate with minimal required permissions
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
4. **Assume Breach**: Design assumes compromise and limits blast radius
5. **Verify Explicitly**: Continuous validation of security posture

### Security Layers

#### 1. Network Security
- **mTLS**: Mutual TLS for all inter-service communication
- **Network Policies**: Kubernetes NetworkPolicies for micro-segmentation
- **Service Mesh**: Istio integration for enhanced security
- **Ingress Controls**: WAF and rate limiting at ingress

#### 2. Identity and Access Management
- **RBAC**: Fine-grained Kubernetes RBAC policies
- **OAuth2/OIDC**: Standards-based authentication
- **Service Accounts**: Dedicated accounts with minimal permissions
- **API Keys**: Rotated regularly with secure storage

#### 3. Data Security
- **Encryption at Rest**: All persistent data encrypted
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 minimum for all communications
- **Key Management**: Integration with KMS solutions
- **Data Classification**: Sensitive data identified and protected

#### 4. Application Security
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- **Output Encoding**: Prevention of injection attacks
- **Security Headers**: Proper HTTP security headers
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without information leakage

## Vulnerability Management

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report them through one of these channels:

1. **Email**: security@nephoran.io
2. **Security Advisory**: [Create a private security advisory](https://github.com/thc1006/nephoran-intent-operator/security/advisories/new)
3. **Bug Bounty**: Details at https://nephoran.io/security/bug-bounty

Include the following information:
- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of affected source files
- Location of affected code (tag/branch/commit)
- Step-by-step reproduction instructions
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact assessment and potential consequences

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Vulnerability Confirmation**: Within 72 hours
- **Patch Development**: Based on severity
  - Critical: 24-48 hours
  - High: 3-5 days
  - Medium: 7-14 days
  - Low: 30 days
- **Public Disclosure**: Coordinated after patch release

### Severity Levels

| Severity | CVSS Score | Examples |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Critical | 9.0-10.0   | RCE, Authentication bypass, Data breach |
