# WORKFLOW CONSOLIDATION PLAN - EMERGENCY CI FIX
# =============================================================================
# This file documents the consolidation of 38+ conflicting workflows
# into a single production-ready pipeline to resolve PR 176 CI failures
# =============================================================================

# =============================================================================
# PROBLEM ANALYSIS
# =============================================================================
# 
# Root Causes of CI Failure Cascade:
# 1. **Workflow Proliferation**: 38 workflow files causing conflicts
# 2. **Resource Contention**: Multiple workflows competing for runners
# 3. **Cache Conflicts**: Inconsistent caching strategies across workflows  
# 4. **Timeout Inadequacy**: 5-8 min timeouts for 728 dependencies (~90MB)
# 5. **Error Propagation**: Failed Quick Validation ‚Üí CI Status failure
#
# Specific Failure Pattern (PR 176):
# - Quick Validation job (ci-optimized.yml) times out during go mod download
# - CI Status job fails because it depends on Quick Validation success
# - Cold cache scenario requires downloading 728 dependencies
# - Heavy cloud SDKs (AWS/Azure/GCP) + Kubernetes ecosystem = slow downloads
#
# =============================================================================
# CONSOLIDATION STRATEGY  
# =============================================================================
#
# BEFORE (38+ workflows):
# - ci-2025.yml (DISABLED)
# - ci-optimized.yml (CAUSING FAILURES)
# - ci-production.yml 
# - ci-reliability-optimized.yml
# - ci-timeout-fix.yml
# - ci-ultra-optimized-2025.yml
# - container-build-2025.yml
# - dev-fast-fixed.yml
# - k8s-operator-ci-2025.yml
# - main-ci-optimized.yml (DISABLED)
# - nephoran-ci-2025-consolidated.yml
# - nephoran-master-orchestrator.yml
# - pr-ci-fast.yml (DEPRECATED)
# - pr-validation.yml
# - security-scan*.yml (multiple versions)
# - ubuntu-ci.yml (DISABLED)
# - ... and 20+ more
#
# AFTER (1 workflow):
# - nephoran-ci-2025-production.yml (NEW CONSOLIDATED PIPELINE)
