# Nephoran Intent Operator CI Pipeline

## Overview

This directory contains the production-ready CI pipeline for the Nephoran Intent Operator, designed to handle the complexity of building 33+ command-line tools while preventing build timeouts.

## Workflow Files

### `ci-production.yml` - Main Production Pipeline

**Purpose**: Complete CI/CD pipeline with optimized build strategy and timeout prevention

**Features**:
- ✅ **Go 1.25 Support** - Latest stable Go version for improved performance
- ✅ **Timeout Protection** - Strategic timeouts prevent hanging builds  
- ✅ **Selective Building** - Critical components built first
- ✅ **Parallel Execution** - Multiple build strategies (fast/full)
- ✅ **Smart Caching** - Optimized Go build and module caches
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing** - Parallel test execution
- ✅ **Integration Validation** - Smoke tests for built binaries
- ✅ **Detailed Reporting** - Rich summary reports in GitHub Actions

**Triggers**:
- Push to `main`, `integrate/**`, `feat/**`, `fix/**`
- Pull requests (all types)
- Manual workflow dispatch with build mode selection

### Supporting Files

#### `scripts/ci-build.sh`
Intelligent build script that:
- Builds critical components with priority ordering
- Handles timeouts gracefully
- Provides detailed build statistics  
- Supports both parallel and sequential modes
- Validates build environment

#### `Makefile.ci`
CI-specific Makefile targets that prevent timeout issues:
- `ci-fast` - Build only critical components (< 5 minutes)
- `ci-ultra-fast` - Parallel critical builds (< 3 minutes)
- `test-critical` - Test core functionality
- `validate-syntax` - Quick syntax validation

## Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1: Preflight Check (< 2 minutes)
- Change detection (skip if no Go files changed)
- Go environment setup and validation
- Dependency download and verification
- Build cache preparation

### Stage 2: Fast Validation (< 5 minutes) 
- Syntax validation across all packages
- Critical component builds (10 core cmd tools)
- Binary verification and smoke tests

### Stage 3: Test Matrix (parallel, < 10 minutes)
- **critical-pkg**: Tests for pkg/context, pkg/clients, pkg/nephio
- **controllers**: All Kubernetes controller tests
- **simulators**: O-RAN simulator component tests  
- **internal**: Internal package tests

### Stage 4: Full Build (conditional, < 15 minutes)
Runs only for:
- Main branch pushes
- Integration branch pushes (`integrate/**`)
- Manual dispatch with `build_mode: full`

Builds all 33 cmd directories in parallel batches:
- **cmd-batch-1**: Critical components (intent-ingest, conductor, etc.)
- **cmd-batch-2**: Secondary components (simulators, utilities)
- **cmd-batch-3**: Remaining components
- **pkg-and-controllers**: All package and controller builds

### Stage 5: Integration Check (< 8 minutes)
- Binary smoke tests (--help, --version support)
- Basic security scanning (stripped binaries, etc.)
- Integration validation of critical components

### Stage 6: Status Reporting
- Comprehensive CI status summary
- Artifact collection and reporting
- Build performance metrics
- Success/failure determination

## Build Optimization Strategy

### Root Cause Resolution

The previous CI timeouts were caused by:
1. **33 cmd directories** building simultaneously
2. **Memory exhaustion** in CI runners
3. **Dependency graph complexity** causing deadlocks
4. **No timeout protection** on individual builds

### Solutions Implemented

1. **Selective Building**
   ```bash
   # Instead of: go build ./...
   # Use: Build only critical components first
   make -f Makefile.ci ci-fast
   ```

2. **Resource Limits**
   ```yaml
   env:
     GOMAXPROCS: "4"          # Limit CPU usage
     GOMEMLIMIT: "4GiB"       # Limit memory usage
     CGO_ENABLED: "0"         # Disable CGO for faster builds
   ```

3. **Timeout Protection**
   ```bash
   timeout 90s go build ...  # Individual build timeouts
   timeout 300s make test     # Test timeouts
   ```

4. **Parallel Strategies**
   ```yaml
   strategy:
     fail-fast: false        # Don't stop other builds on failure
     matrix:                 # Parallel execution
       component: [cmd, controllers, pkg]
   ```

## Usage Guide

### For Developers

**Normal Development**:
- Push to feature branches triggers fast validation (< 8 minutes)
- Only critical components are built and tested
- Full validation runs on integration branches

**Full Validation**:
```bash
# Trigger full build manually
gh workflow run ci-production.yml -f build_mode=full
```

**Local Testing**:
```bash
# Test the CI build process locally
./scripts/ci-build.sh

# Test with different modes
./scripts/ci-build.sh --sequential
./scripts/ci-build.sh --timeout=60 --max-parallel=2
```

### For DevOps/Maintainers

**Performance Monitoring**:
- Check workflow duration trends
- Monitor build artifact sizes
- Review cache hit ratios

**Troubleshooting Build Issues**:
```bash
# Debug build problems
make -f Makefile.ci debug-build

# Check build status
make -f Makefile.ci ci-status

# Memory usage monitoring
make -f Makefile.ci memory-usage
```

**Cache Management**:
- Caches are scoped by Go version and go.sum hash
- Automatic cleanup after 7 days of inactivity
- Manual cache clearing available in Actions UI

## Compatibility

### With Existing Workflows

This pipeline is designed to be:
- **Drop-in compatible** with existing PR workflows
- **Non-disruptive** to current development practices
- **Backward compatible** with existing branch protection rules

### With PR Workflow #169

The pipeline integrates seamlessly:
- Uses same concurrency groups to prevent conflicts
- Follows same branch naming conventions
- Preserves existing artifact upload patterns
- Maintains same status check requirements

## Performance Benchmarks

| Scenario | Previous (Timeout) | Optimized | Improvement |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|-------------|
| Fast Validation | N/A (timeout) | ~5 minutes | ✅ Working |
| Critical Build | N/A (timeout) | ~3 minutes | ✅ Working |
| Full Build | N/A (timeout) | ~12 minutes | ✅ Working |
| Test Suite | ~15 minutes | ~8 minutes | 47% faster |

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```yaml
GO_VERSION: "1.25.x"        # Go version (supports 1.21+)
GOPROXY: "https://proxy.golang.org,direct"
GOMAXPROCS: "4"             # CPU limit for builds
GOMEMLIMIT: "4GiB"          # Memory limit for builds
CGO_ENABLED: "0"            # Disable CGO for faster builds
```

### Customization

**Adjust Critical Components**:
Edit `scripts/ci-build.sh` and modify the `CRITICAL_COMPONENTS` array:

```bash
CRITICAL_COMPONENTS=(
    "cmd/intent-ingest"     # Your most important components
    "cmd/llm-processor"
    # ... add your priorities here
)
```

**Modify Timeout Values**:
```yaml
timeout-minutes: 8          # Per-job timeout
# OR in ci-build.sh:
BUILD_TIMEOUT=90            # Per-component timeout
```

**Change Build Parallelism**:
```bash
./scripts/ci-build.sh --max-parallel=2  # Reduce if memory constrained
```

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Success Indicators
