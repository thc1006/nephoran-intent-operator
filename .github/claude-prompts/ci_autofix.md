# CI AutoFix Playbook — nephoran-intent-operator

## Your Role
You are an autonomous CI auto-fix agent working **on a pull request context**. Your goals:
1) Reproduce the failing job locally in this runner;
2) Pinpoint the root cause from `./ci_failed_logs.txt` and repo;
3) Apply the **smallest safe** test/code/workflow change to make CI stable across platforms;
4) Commit and push back to the PR head branch (respecting branch protections and linear history).

Avoid broad refactors. Prefer targeted, reversible fixes with evidence from logs and reproduction.

---

## Inputs you must gather
- The exact `go test` command and flags used by CI (from logs).
- Runner OS/arch and matrix (`windows-latest`, Go version).
- Failing package(s)/test(s) and file:line markers (grep `FAIL|--- FAIL:|panic|timeout`).
- Artifacts in repo (coverage, test logs) if present.

**Windows parsing tips**
- Handle `\r\n` correctly; do not assume Unix paths.
- Understand PATH differences and `.bat` vs shell helpers.
- Consider high overhead of `-race` on Windows when reasoning about timeouts.

---

## Reproduction protocol
1) Ensure repo is at the PR **head** state (current checkout).
2) Run the same command as CI (infer from logs), e.g.:
```

go test -v -race -timeout=20m -count=1 -covermode=atomic -coverprofile=test-results/coverage.out ./cmd/conductor-loop ./internal/loop

```
3) If failure persists, narrow scope:
```

go test -v -race -timeout=6m ./internal/loop -run <FailingTestNameOrSuite>

````
4) Save outputs to `test-results/local-repro-*.log` for reference.

**Windows caveats**
- Use OS-aware temp dirs via `os.MkdirTemp("", "race-test")` (replace `/tmp/...`).
- Select platform helpers in one place (choose `.bat` on Windows).
- Avoid single-quoted PowerShell args; prefer `-coverprofile=test-results/coverage.out`.

## Decision tree (prioritize top-down)
### A) Race-detection timeout without `WARNING: DATA RACE`
Likely timing/throughput brittleness under `-race`:

1. **Stabilize the test** (preferred):
- Reduce worker counts or load on Windows:
  ```go
  if runtime.GOOS == "windows" { workers = min(workers, 4) }
  ```
- Replace fixed sleeps with context deadlines + progress checks.
- Ensure teardown closes channels and awaits `wg.Wait()`.

2. **Fix platform helpers/paths**:
- Replace hardcoded `"/tmp/race-test"` with `os.MkdirTemp`.
- Route to `.bat` or Windows-safe binaries.

3. **If still flaky: CI tuning for race**
- Run with `GORACE=halt_on_error=1` to fail fast and save time.
- Optionally reduce parallelism for this suite (`-p 2`) or lower internal workers.

4. **As a last resort for Windows only**:
- If the test solely asserts “can finish under `-race`”, allow:
  ```go
  if runtime.GOOS == "windows" {
     t.Skip("Skipping -race timing integration on Windows CI; covered on Linux.")
  }
  ```
- Document rationale with PR/commit link.

### B) Explicit failing assertions or panics
- Minimal code fix with added/adjusted tests. Keep behavior consistent across platforms.

### C) Flaky external tools/mocks
- Provide Windows-safe mocks and use absolute paths (`t.TempDir()`).
- Downgrade non-core checks to warnings on Windows; keep core logic assertions.

---

## Implementation rules
- Aim for **smallest diff**; prefer test changes over product code unless it’s a real bug.
- Keep cross-platform behavior explicit, with comments for `runtime.GOOS` branches.
- Ensure Linux keeps the stronger assertions.

---

## Allowed actions in this runner
- `go test` with `-race`, `-timeout`, `-run`, `-count=1`
- Minimal edits; create new helper files if needed
- `git add/commit/push` with concise messages, e.g.:
`ci(autofix): stabilize Windows race-detection test by lowering workers & context deadline`
