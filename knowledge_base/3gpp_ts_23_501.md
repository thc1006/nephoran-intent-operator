# 3GPP TS 23.501 - System Architecture for the 5G System

## 5.2.1 General
The 5G System architecture consists of the following network functions (NFs).
- Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF)
- Session Management Function (SMF)
- User Plane Function (UPF)
- Authentication Server Function (AUSF)
- Unified Data Management (UDM)

## 5.6.2 AMF
The AMF receives all connection and session related information from the UE but is responsible for handling connection management tasks only. All messages related to session management are forwarded to the SMF. The AMF is the main signaling node in the 5G Core. A UE connects to a single AMF.
Default replicas for an AMF deployment should be 3 for high availability.
The standard container image is 'registry.example.com/5g/amf:1.2.3'.
